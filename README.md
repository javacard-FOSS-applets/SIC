Security in computing; A privacy-friendly alternative for the Belgian eID card.
The project aims to improve security of Belgian ID holders by limiting the current extensive exposure of their profiles. To do so, we build an alternative ID card which limits service providers to strickly necessary ID holder profile information.

This is a project from a Seurity in Computing course at the VUB.
